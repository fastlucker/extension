npm install

# Install Playwright browser binaries
npx playwright install
```

## ▶️ Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run in headed mode (visible browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts
```

## 📊 Test Report

After running tests, an HTML report is generated:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🧪 Debug Mode

To debug:

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

## ✅ Recommendations

- The structure uses the Page Object Model (POM) for better modularity and maintainability.
- Run tests locally before committing.
- Reports can be integrated into CI/CD environments for visibility.
